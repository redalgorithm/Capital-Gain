# Capital-Gain
This program takes as input a sequence of transactions of the form “buy x share(s) at $y each” or “sell x share(s) at $y each,” assuming that the transactions occur on consecutive days and the values x and y are integers.  Given this input sequence, the output will be the total capital gain (or loss) for the entire sequence, using the FIFO protocol to identify shares.
